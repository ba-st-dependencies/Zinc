# Zinc HTTP Components

A fork of the `Zinc` framework to be used as a dependency in [ba-st](https://github.com/ba-st)
for GS/64.

The `upstream` branch is supposed to track the changes in
the main branch of [svenvc/zinc](https://github.com/svenvc/zinc).

The `release-candidate` is the branch where our changes land before releasing a version.

Zinc HTTP Components is an open-source Smalltalk framework
to deal with the HTTP networking protocol.
